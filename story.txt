Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the hills,
there lived a young girl named Lila.
She had always been curious about the world beyond her village,
but the elders warned her that the forest near the mountains was cursed.
One day, however, her curiosity got the best of her.
Lila decided to venture into the forest, despite the warnings.Hello 123
